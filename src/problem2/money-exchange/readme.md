1. This form use `Create-React-App with Typescript` for scaffolding, `styled-components` for styling, `axios` for sending https request.
2. Form can render currency data from api, perform 2 ways convert with onChange event
3. My initial plan is using with `react-hook-form` for validation and format currency , and `zod` for schema design, but there is some issue during the implementation
